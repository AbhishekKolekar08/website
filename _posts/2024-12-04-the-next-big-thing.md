> **"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."**

The quote, taken from George Santayana's book [_The Life of Reason_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15000/15000-h/15000-h.htm) (1905), is echoed by Winston Churchill, and gives a cautionary tales of the past and the future. Time and again, humanity has fallen into the trap of speculative excess, resulting in catastrophic outcomes like:
- [The Wall Street Crash of 1929](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/stock-market-crash-of-1929): Fuelled by over-leveraging and belief that stock prices would never fall.
- [Dot-Com Bubble of the 1990s](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/dotcom-bubble/): Driven by the hype around the transformative potential of the internet, leading to inflated valuations of tech start-ups.
- [Financial Crisis of 2007-08](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/crisis/chap1.pdf): Blown by access to easy credit, subprime lending, and belief that housing prices would never fall.

While the reasonings are simplified here, the key factor uniting these debacles is the capitalization on the illusion of investment invincibility, fuelled by a venture capitalist-esque narrative of 'The Next Big Thing’.

Unfortunately, the automotive industry is not impervious to the influence of such narratives, with significant investments being made chasing the allure of industry-revolutionizing innovation, which begs a couple of questions: Are we innovating for progress or chasing hype? And perhaps more importantly from a business standpoint, are we truly moving in the direction consumers want, or are we simply assuming that this 'progress' is what they need?
# Autonomous Disasters?
[Road injury is the 12th highest cause of death](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/375016/9789240086517-eng.pdf?sequence=1) among all ages, with [human factors](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10154805/) like recklessness, speeding, distraction, drunk driving, tiredness, driving under influence being significant causes. Replacing drivers with automations should, in theory, reduce the number of accidents. Moreover, sci-fi and cinema have made the working of autonomous vehicles seem shockingly effortless, not to say extremely cool. So, in conclusion, a system that improves road safety, frees up the passengers from the mundane task of driving, all while looking futuristic, i.e., Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) should be an ideal solution, right?

Well, yes, but also no. While autonomous vehicles promise safety and convenience, the reality is far more complex, just like the implementation of a system to which one can responsibly and reliably outsource agency on a consistent basis. It is riddled with issues of technological reliability and ethical and moral ambiguity. For instance, the dilemma of programming a car to choose who survives in the event of a crash—often posed in studies like [MIT's Moral Machine](https://www.moralmachine.net/)—illustrates the deep ethical quandaries that need to be addressed. This also means navigating the wide range of ethical views that consumers hold—whether deontological (duty-based) or utilitarian (outcome-based)—which is another monumental challenge.

Keeping the moral quagmire aside, rushing into getting AVs on road without reliability testing of the highest standard has [resulted in over 190 accidents in 2022 according to KNRLegal](https://www.knrlegal.com/car-accident-lawyer/self-driving-car-accident-statistics/), 5 of which were fatal. Per the same source, only 16% of the consumers interviewed feel comfortable in fully autonomous vehicles, while 57% are outspokenly uncomfortable. On top of it all, there is also the issue of liability in the event of an accident involving AVs—whether responsibility should fall on the passenger or the parent company. Tesla's Full Self-Driving terms of service and user agreements make it clear that drivers are responsible for the safe operation of their vehicles, and [must take over in case of hazardous situation](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html). Volvo, on the other hand, [has claimed to accept "full liability" for its AVs.](https://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-will-accept-full-liability-for-its-autonomous-vehicles/)

All these problems reflects broader skepticism about AVs’ safety and legality. AVs are undoubtedly a bold step going forward, but automakers, and by extension legislators, should focus on refining these innovations until they are objectively safe and reliable. Before that happens, the rush to label them as 'The Next Big Thing' discounts the gap between business aspirations and technological and consumer readiness.
# Electrifying Trends, Shocking Realities
[Yes, electric vehicles are better for the environment](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths) undoubtedly, but T&C apply. 

There has been extensive research about [how EVs reduce CO2 emissions over the lifecycle](https://www.energysage.com/electric-vehicles/evs-vs-ices-full-lifecycle-environmental-impact-analysis/) in comparison to a conventional internal combustion vehicle [for a plethora of vehicles](https://www.carboncounter.com/#!/explore). They have zero tailpipe emissions, [lower running cost](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/electric-vs-gas-cars-it-cheaper-drive-ev), [lesser maintenance cost](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EV-Ownership-Cost-Final-Report-1.pdf), [are fun to zoom around in](https://jalopnik.com/are-electric-cars-as-fun-as-gasoline-cars-i-drove-a-po-1848089011), [reduce noise pollution](https://electricvehiclehub.com.au/information-centre/how-evs-quietly-combat-noise-pollution/), [enjoy exemption from taxes, and registration and insurance benefits](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-policy-explorer). There is well-deserved global push from governments and media for the adoption of electric vehicles. It does the same job as an internal combustion engine, better in many ways, while being green and sustainable, with only a few minor inconveniences. Seems like the perfect recipe for 'The Next Big Thing'—or is it?

EVs are a lot of things going for them, not without their own caveats and counterpoints to consider. The [sustainability of rare-earth elements](https://www.idtechex.com/en/research-article/rare-earths-in-evs-problems-solutions-and-what-is-actually-happening/25071) as its demand increases to cope with heightened EV R&D and manufacturing is a point of contention. However, [automakers and suppliers pushing to cut rare earths from EVs](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/automakers-suppliers-pushing-cut-rare-earths-evs-2023-11-14/). 

Localizing manufacturing, especially for batteries, seems to be a priority for [Europe](https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/an-industrial-blueprint-for-batteries-in-europe) and [the USA](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/EDF_US_EV_Manufacturing_Investments_Spring2024.pdf), to [reduce reliance on overseas supply chains](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chinas-dominance-in-battery-manufacturing/) with substantial efforts and investments having been made to accomplish this. However, scaling these facilities to meet the demands from automotive OEMs have faced numerous challenges, exemplified by [Northvolt’s struggle](https://www.reuters.com/technology/northvolt-crisis-may-be-make-or-break-europes-ev-battery-ambitions-2024-11-22/), illustrating how difficult it is to balance ambitious plans with economic realities. The economic structures present in the western countries lay down a crucial challenge for stakeholders trying to set up localized manufacturing of EVs and their batteries. This challenge is highlighted by a surprising perspective from the consumer tech channel [Linus Tech Tips, which notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xayoYq5bfaM&t=450s):
>"As heartless as it sounds, the math says, that our standard of living in the western world is enabled by unfettered access to cheap overseas labour."
